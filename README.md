V-Arcade is a framework with serious games to support upper limbs rehabilitation for children.

This framework has been developed with Unity 2017 and it compatible with Leap Motion V2, MacOs and Windows. 

The framework contains:

- A "children app"  with four serious games supporting wrists and forearm rehabilitation (ulnar and radial deviation, flexion and extension, pronation and supination of the forearm)

- A "therapist app"  specific for the therapist to manage children's progresses remotely and a server to store data about the exercises' performed by children

The four serious games are: Rich Race, Music Beats, Alien Invasion and Shooting Gallery; each serious game offers different physiotherapy exercises. 
The child plays with the game through the Leap Motion Controller that tracks child's hand movements converting it in movements of the character. In Rich Race the child controls a car and has to drive in a circuit, in Music Beats the child plays with both hands and should beat them following music rythm, in Shooting Gallery the child contro0ls the poiter of a gun and has to hit each target with the pointer, in Alien Invasion the child controls a spaceship and has to shoot to all the aliens.

The hand tracking data collected through the leap motion (the Leap frames) are stored and saved in the server allowing the therapist to watch through the therapist app a digital hand performing the same gestures made by the child. 

The therapist, with their app, can also personalize the exercises generating new levels for each game in addition to the stanard levels present in each game.

This framework was presented at Segah 2021 conference:
